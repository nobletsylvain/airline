# Economic Parameters — Reference Document

**Version:** 0.1  
**Date:** January 2026  
**Companion to:** Game Design Document v0.7, Historical Airlines Database v0.1

---

## Overview

This document defines era-specific economic parameters for Airliner. Each historical scenario uses period-accurate prices, costs, and revenues to maintain authenticity while preserving realistic profit margins and gameplay balance.

**Core Principle:** Year-accurate absolute values, ratio-preserved economics. A 747 costs $24M in 1978 and $150M in 2020 — but both eras produce similar margin percentages when operated well.

**Why This Matters:**
- Players see authentic numbers (immersion)
- Each era feels economically distinct
- No cross-era comparison needed (scenarios are self-contained)
- Gameplay tension comes from ratios, not absolutes

## 1. Design Philosophy

### 1.1 What Stays Consistent Across Eras

| Parameter | Target Range | Notes |
|-----------|--------------|-------|
| Operating margin (well-run) | 8-15% | Achievable with good management |
| Operating margin (average) | 2-6% | Industry typical |
| Operating margin (struggling) | -5% to +2% | Turnaround needed |
| Fuel as % of operating costs | 20-35% | Varies with oil prices |
| Labor as % of operating costs | 25-35% | Higher in regulated eras |
| Aircraft ownership as % of costs | 15-25% | Lease vs own affects this |
| Break-even load factor | 60-75% | Depends on yield/cost structure |

### 1.2 What Changes Per Era

| Parameter | Changes Because |
|-----------|-----------------|
| Aircraft prices | Inflation, technology, production costs |
| Fuel prices | Oil market conditions |
| Ticket prices | Regulation, competition, inflation |

## 10. Scenario Calibration

### 10.1 Victory Condition Tuning

For each historical scenario, victory conditions are calibrated against:

| Metric | Bronze | Silver | Gold |
|--------|--------|--------|------|
| Survival probability (historical) | 30-50% | 15-30% | 5-15% |
| Operating margin target | Break-even | 5%+ | 10%+ |
| Fleet growth vs history | Match | +25% | +50% |
| Network growth vs history | Match | +20% | +40% |

### 10.2 Economic Event Intensity

Scenario scripted events use intensity modifiers:

| Event Type | Mild | Moderate | Severe |
|------------|------|----------|--------|
| Oil shock | +30% fuel cost | +80% fuel cost | +150% fuel cost |
| Recession | -10% demand | -20% demand | -35% demand |
| Currency crisis | -15% revenue (affected routes) | -30% revenue | -50% revenue |

| 1970s | High fares offset by high fuel/labor; regulation limits competition |
| 1980s | Deregulation = price wars; bankruptcy is real threat |
| 1990s | Lower fuel, growing demand; expansion opportunity |
| 2000s | 9/11 + fuel volatility; survival focus |
| 2010s | Consolidation benefits; LCC pressure |
| 2020s | COVID recovery; sustainability costs |

## 12. Future Considerations

### 12.1 Not in v1.0

- Dynamic inflation during gameplay (prices fixed at scenario start)
- Currency trading/hedging beyond fuel
- Detailed regional economic modeling
- Real-time economic events (scripted only)

### 12.2 Designed For

- Easy addition of new eras
- Modding support for custom economic scenarios
- Historical accuracy patches as research improves
